## Intro
A few scripts to illustrate how to plot antenna patterns.
Currently this includes 1-dimensional linearly-spaced arrays.

## Requirements
I've tested this code with:
- Python 3.10.5 (64-bit), installed to `C:\Program Files\Python310\`)
- Visual Studio Code, with the following extensions
  - Python (from Microsoft)
  - Jupyter (from Microsoft)

The python module requirements are in `requirements.txt`. You can easily install them using

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

(Or, just `pip install numpy jupyter` and let it figure out all of the dependencies from there.)

## Getting Started
You should just be able to
- open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- open the example .py file
- Select Python 3.10.5 64-bit as your python interpreter (in `C:\Program Files\Python310\python.exe`)
- select/highlight the code you want to run
- right-click > Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window
